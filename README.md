# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest

Background: Diabetes is a major health problem that affects many people around the world. 
Objectives: To solve this problem, we use data from Kaggle, a popular data-sharing site. Methods: We use computer intelligence called a random forest algorithm to test for diabetes based on age, diabetes level and other factors. 
Statistical Analysis: Our random forest model has proven to be very effective at accounting for complex patterns in data, helping us accurately predict whether a person will develop diabetes. Findings: Our method stands out because we focus on factual accuracy, which makes it different from other methods. 
Applications and Improvements: This study, part of the growing use of computers in healthcare, shows that random forest tools may be a reliable and easy way to diagnose early diabetes.
